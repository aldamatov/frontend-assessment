# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.


###### Exercise 2
---
Read the `data.json` file and display the data as tabs on desktop and an accordion on mobile.

##### Requirements
1. Display data in tabs on desktop.
2. Display data in an accordion on mobile.
3. Only 1 accordion/tab should be open at a time.
4. Open the first accordion/tab on load.
5. If the open accordion is selected, close it.

###### Bonus points
* Improve the user experience with meaningful animations/transitions.
* Design and styling.
* Explain why the result of `('b' + 'a' + + 'a' + 'a').toLowerCase()` is `banana`.
